Net::SMTP::OneLiner
=======================

BLURB

A friend of mine was telling me that ruby, or python, or php or
something had an easier one line send mail function; and that
Net::SMTP was "too hard" to use in practice.

I chortled and cranked this out.  In truth, a single function
mail send function sounded just peachy.  I even use this myself
-- unless I want to do something phancy with Net::SMTP.

Then again, using modules you wrote for yourself and a friend
comes naturally.

Whatever,

(Let me know if you use this.)

EXAMPLES:

send_mail($to, $from, $subject, $msg);
send_mail('me@domain', 'you@domain', "heyya there", "supz!?!?");
send_mail(\@your_group_list, $from, $subject, $msg, $cc, $bcc);
