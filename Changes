   - couple little tweaks to content encoding, message IDs, etc.  

2.0007: Fri Mar 28 2014
   - more errors

2.0005: Wed Jul 08 2009
   - cleaned up this distribution
   - fixed various pod problems
   - added critic stuff
   - fixed pet peve most hated bug ever (paul@cpan.org is not me,
     I am jettero@cpan.org)
   - modernized the makefile and posted module on github

2.0: Fri Mar  6 11:26:01 EST 2009
   - ditched version.pm (doesn't work reliably)
   - added content encoding and transfers

1.4.0: Sun Oct 19 13:15:01 EDT 2008
   - made the subject optional

1.3.3: Tue May 27 12:02:10 EDT 2008
   - (wow, use version has to be on the same line as our $VERSION
      for older EUMM)

1.3.2: Tue May 27 07:30:11 EDT 2008
   - still forgot the version.pm

1.3.1: Mon May 26 15:42:56 EDT 2008
   - I might as well do a new version of everything using
     version.pm while I wait for all my CPAN deletes to go
     through.  I just discovered that version.pm doesn't/didn't
     go core until perl 5.9...  I really wish I'd have prereqed
     it everywhere I used it, but I didn't.  *sigh*

1.3.0:
   - using version.pm as suggested by Andreas Koenig
   - added a PORT option, which arguably already existed in
     HOSTNAME

1.2.0: Tue Aug 23 07:05:38 EDT 2005
   - I made cc and bcc work just like to.  You can also send
     messages with only bcc's.  Lastly, bcc's weren't working at
     all until I fixed the bug pointed out by Stephen Thomas.
